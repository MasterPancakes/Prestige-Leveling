# Disclaimer
This bot uses google sheets as a level database. Google sheets is not built for databases so do not try and overload the sheet.

Also, this bot uses the endpoint message.create, meaning it will use one of your API requests everytime a user sends a message. This floods your API request limit, so be careful when using this in large servers.
